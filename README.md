# Welcome to the TokTok IDE

You can edit toxcore C files here and see how they compile. Currently, this is
under development. If you want to do real work here, please talk to iphy on
IRC, first.

To get started, use the tree on the left to navigate to the
`c-toxcore/toxcore` directory and click any `.c`, `.cpp`, or `.h` file. Make a
change, and watch the build kick off after 5 seconds.
